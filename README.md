The application provides an intuitive workflow that guides users through the complete data management process. Users begin by uploading files through the drag-and-drop interface, proceed to review and edit data in the interactive grid, configure validation rules and business logic, set system priorities, and finally export cleaned data and configuration files for downstream processing.
The interface includes contextual help tooltips, keyboard shortcuts for power users, and responsive design that works effectively on both desktop and tablet devices. The professional design aesthetic makes the platform suitable for enterprise use while maintaining ease of use for less technical users.

This comprehensive AI-enabled data management platform represents a modern approach to handling business data, combining the power of Next.js, AI validation, and intuitive user experience design to create a robust solution for data processing workflows.
